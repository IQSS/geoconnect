### Abstract

```This data contains all 331,447 parcels (i.e., the smallest unit for which a deed can be held) in Boston, based on the Master Address List provided by the City of Boston. Parcel variables are split into two categories: identifying characteristics and geographic information. Identifying characteristics include information regarding the basic identity and attributes of the parcel. Geographic information provides further detail on the location of the parcel and the other geographies that contain it. These variables were derived by geocoding the parcels against the 2013 Census TIGER Line data.

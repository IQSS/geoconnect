As of the 2010 census, Boston, MA contains 7,288 city blocks, defined as any piece of land bounded by streets or water on all sides, and not divided by any streets or water. These are nested in 558 block groups, which are themselves nested in 178 census tracts. Census geographies are a natural hierarchy, with the unique identifier at each level being an extension of the level above it, indicating the specific region and all of the higher-order regions that contain it.

<br /><br />Census variables are split into two categories: identifying characteristics and geographic information. Variables are consistent across all three census levels, though some variables appear in one file and not in others. Identifying characteristics includes variables regarding the basic identity and attributes of the block. Geographic information provides further detail on the location of the block and the other geographies that contain it. Nesting started with the block level, because all geographies, census or otherwise, conform to block boundaries. Linking to non-census geographies was done by identifying the location of the centroid of each block.

<br /><br />Because block groups and tracts do not nest perfectly within non-census geographies, this linking was done by identifying the region that contained the plurality of the block group or tractâ€™s land area. Some non-census geographies crossed over census the boundaries of a particular level too often, however, to make such linkages reliable, and thus were omitted: for block groups, Precincts were not linked; for tracts, Precincts, Neighborhood Statistical Areas, and ZIP Codes were not linked.

<br /><br /><i>Note: Although this data is in the 2015 BARI Geographical Infrastructure dataverse, the data is from the 2010 Census. However, between years BARI may fill in missing information within the Census files, so it is still best to use the Census files from the latest Geographical Infrastructure Dataverse. This data set includes a series of census indicators for tracts. These are not listed and described in the current version of the documentation, however.</i>
